5.	How the system works
a)	OTP Verification:
•	The user starts by entering a 6-digit OTP (One-Time Password) in the provided OTP field.
•	Once the OTP is entered, the user clicks the "Verify" button.
•	Upon successful OTP verification, the user is redirected to the next page containing the multi-step registration form.
b)	Multi-Step Registration Form:
•	After OTP verification, the user is presented with a multi-step form.
•	This form is divided into several steps, each with specific fields for input.
•	A progress bar at the top of the page visually tracks the user’s progress through each step.
•	Users can navigate through the steps by clicking "Next" or "Previous" buttons, allowing them to review and update their information as needed.
•	Each step is dynamically rendered based on the user’s current progress.
